# ranciliopid
Rancilio-Silvia PID für Arduino http://rancilio-pid.de

BETA VERSION

Version 1.9.8h

# Additional important information
- Copy file userConfig.h.SAMPLE to userConfig.h and edit this file accordingly.
- Additional Arduino dependency on PubSubClient (tested with Version 2.7.0). 
  Please install this lib by using Arduino->Sketch->Include Library->"Library Manager".

# Tunings instructions
- 2 Step Coldstart:
  Set STARTTEMP variable to around 80 degree celcius and cold start the maschine. Wait until the heater goes from 100% to 0%, and after some time the heater's lamp starts blinking again. Write down the current temperature at this moment and increase the STARTTEMP variable by the difference of the written down temperature to your SETPOINT. Shutdown your machine and let it cool down. Do this multiple times until the temperature is correct.

# Changelog
- 1.9.8h:
  - Feature: Implemented special 2 step cold-start mechanism. See special tuning instructions above.
- 1.9.8g:
  - Improvement: Broken temperature is detected when temp has increased more than >5 degrees (previous 25 degrees) in the last 0.4 seconds.
  - Improvement: Better brewReady detection by waiting for stable temperature within a longer time window (from 6 to 14secs).
  - TemperatureHistory increased from 6 seconds to 30seconds.
- 1.9.8f:
  - Added missing config.h.SAMPLE variables.
  - Added some more mqtt events.
- 1.9.8e:
  - Removed movAvg() due to several issues:
    - This is no moving avg, but something different (but it is working for "stable" temperature curves).
    - readIndex=0 is not used.
    - movingAvg does not compares currentValue with previousValue.
    - Faktor *100 makes no sense (?).
    - initializing methods/firstreading is refactored.
  - movAvg() is replaced by pastTemperatureChange() (+ updateTemperatureHistory())
  - Change order of brew-detection in main loop() to not confuse bPid.compute() due to flapping setTunings()
  - Feature: isBrewReady() to determine if temperature is stable to start brewing
  - Bugfix: Replace abs() with fabs().
- 1.9.8d:
- 1.9.8c:
  - Add more mqtt updates: kp,ki,kd, coldstart
  - Safe-guard: be sure pid internals are cleared when pid is dis/enabled.
- 1.9.8b:
  - Feature: Add support for MQTT.
  - Safeguard: HeaterPreventFlapping must never be > windowSize.
- 1.9.7:
  - Fix: If temperature sensor detects more than 150Celcius then it must be an error.
  - Fix: Typos / explanations.
  - Fix: Race condition when code is blocked for some time
  - Fix: Added initial temp poll to prevent error on start.
  - Feature: Detect missing temperature polls.
  - Feature: Add configurable BLYNKPORT.
  - Feature: Wifi hostname configuable.
  - New feature: Safe-guard: Stop heating forever if sensor is flapping!
  - Fix: Pid.Compute() is now in sync with isrCounter and is not loosing one tick each second. Heater flapping is reduced.
